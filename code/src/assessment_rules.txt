Checklist for Identifying Risks and Compliance Issues

Entity Due Diligence (EDD):
Verify the identity of both entities (KYC compliance).
Check for beneficial ownership transparency.
Screen both entities against sanctions lists (OFAC, UN, EU).
Determine if either entity is a Politically Exposed Person (PEP).
Transaction Monitoring:

Assess the purpose and legitimacy of the transaction.
Identify unusual transaction patterns (e.g., round-dollar amounts, rapid fund transfers).
Monitor for transactions exceeding regulatory thresholds (e.g., $10,000 for CTRs).
Jurisdictional Risks:

Check if either entity operates in high-risk jurisdictions (e.g., FATF-listed countries).
Assess cross-border transactions for compliance with international regulations.
AML and Fraud Risks:

Detect signs of money laundering (e.g., layering, structuring).
Identify potential fraud indicators (e.g., mismatched transaction details).
Ensure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and AML regulations.
Regulatory Compliance:

Verify adherence to Dodd-Frank Act requirements for both entities.
Ensure compliance with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rules.
Check for adherence to state-specific banking regulations.
Transaction Context:

Assess the relationship between the two entities (e.g., parent-subsidiary, vendor-client).
Verify the legitimacy of the transaction's purpose (e.g., invoice matching, contracts).
Monitor for unusual payment methods (e.g., cryptocurrency, prepaid cards).
High-Risk Indicators:

Frequent or large cash transactions between entities.
Transactions involving shell companies or entities with limited operational history.
Discrepancies in transaction documentation or details.
Risk Rating System
Low Risk (1-3): Routine transactions between verified entities with no red flags.
Medium Risk (4-6): Transactions with minor anomalies or involving moderate-risk jurisdictions.
High Risk (7-9): Transactions with significant red flags, high-risk jurisdictions, or unverified entities.
Critical Risk (10): Transactions that violate regulations or involve known fraudulent activity.
Formula for Calculating Risk Rating
You can calculate the risk rating using a weighted scoring system based on key risk factors:

Explanation of Factors:
Entity Risk Score (0-10): Based on the risk profile of both entities (e.g., PEP status, sanctions screening).
Transaction Risk Score (0-10): Based on transaction size, frequency, and patterns.
Jurisdiction Risk Score (0-10): Based on the risk level of the countries involved.
Compliance Risk Score (0-10): Based on adherence to regulatory requirements.
