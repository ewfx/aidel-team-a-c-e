## 🎯 Introduction
The Transaction Risk Assessment API is a FastAPI-based solution designed to assess transaction risks using AI-powered entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and compliance checks. It processes both structured and unstructured transaction data to generate risk assessments and compliance reports.

## 💡 Inspiration
The need for robust financial compliance and risk assessment tools inspired this project. It aims to simplify and automate the process of identifying high-risk transactions, ensuring regulatory compliance, and mitigating fraud.

## ⚙️ What It Does
- Parses CSV files and unstructured text for transaction data.
- Extracts structured transaction details using AI.
- Performs web searches for additional context about entities.
- Analyzes sentiment for entities involved in transactions.
- Evaluates transaction risks based on predefined rules.
- Risk Rating System
   - Low Risk (1-3): Routine transactions between verified entities with no red flags.
   - Medium Risk (4-6): Transactions with minor anomalies or involving moderate-risk jurisdictions.
   - High Risk (7-9): Transactions with significant red flags, high-risk jurisdictions, or unverified entities.
   - Critical Risk (10): Transactions that violate regulations or involve known fraudulent activity.
- Generates detailed risk and compliance reports.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- **Backend**: FastAPI for building the API endpoints.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API and Hugging Face Transformers for entity extraction and sentiment analysis.
- **Web Search**: DuckDuckGo API for fetching additional entity information.
- **Risk Assessment**: Custom rules defined in `assessment_rules.txt` for evaluating transaction risks.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
- Ensuring the accuracy of AI-generated structured data from unstructured text.
- Handling edge cases in transaction data, such as missing fields or invalid formats.
- Integrating multiple APIs (OpenAI, DuckDuckGo) seamlessly.
- Designing a robust risk assessment framework.


## 🏃 How to Run
### Backend
1. Clone the repository  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```sh
   pip install -r code/src/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `app.py` file:
   ```sh
   cd code/src
   ```
4. Run the backend server  
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
5. Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Frontend (UI)
1. Install Streamlit if not already installed:
   ```sh
   pip install streamlit
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `app.py` file:
   ```sh
   cd code/src
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Open the app in your browser (Streamlit will provide a local URL, typically `http://localhost:8501`).
5. Upload a file (CSV or text) and view the results.
